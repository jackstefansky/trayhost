trayhost
========

Package trayhost is a cross-platform Go library to place an icon
in the host operating system's taskbar.

Platform Support
----------------

-	macOS - Fully implemented and supported by [@dmitshur](https://github.com/dmitshur).
-	Linux - Partially implemented, but unsupported (needs an owner/maintainer).
-	Windows - Partially implemented, but unsupported (needs an owner/maintainer).

Notes
-----

On macOS, for Notification Center user notifications to work, your Go binary that
uses `trayhost` must be a part of a standard macOS app bundle.

Most other functionality of `trayhost` will be available if the binary is not a part
of app bundle, but you will get a terminal pop up, and you will not be able to
configure some aspects of the app.

Here's a minimal layout of an app bundle:

```
$ tree "Trayhost Example.app"
Trayhost\ Example.app
└── Contents
    ├── Info.plist
    ├── MacOS
    │   └── example
    └── Resources
        └── Icon.icns
```

Here's a minimal `Info.plist` file as reference (only the entries that are needed,
nothing extra):

```XML
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
	<key>CFBundleExecutable</key>
	<string>example</string>
	<key>CFBundleIconFile</key>
	<string>Icon</string>
	<key>CFBundleIdentifier</key>
	<string>ExampleApp</string>
	<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
	<true/>
	<key>LSUIElement</key>
	<string>1</string>
</dict>
</plist>
```

-	`CFBundleIdentifier` needs to be set to some value for Notification Center to work.
-	The binary must be inside `Contents/MacOS` directory for Notification Center to work.
-	`NSHighResolutionCapable` to enable Retina mode.
-	`LSUIElement` is needed to make the app not appear in Cmd+Tab list and the dock
while still being able to show a tooltip in the menu bar.

On macOS, when you run an app bundle, the working directory of the executed process
is the root directory (`/`), not the app bundle's `Contents/Resources` directory.
Change directory to `Resources` if you need to load resources from there.

```Go
ep, err := os.Executable()
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("os.Executable:", err)
}
err = os.Chdir(filepath.Join(filepath.Dir(ep), "..", "Resources"))
if err != nil {
	log.Fatalln("os.Chdir:", err)
}
```

Installation
------------

```bash
go get -u github.com/jackstefansky/trayhost
```
